# Cupic-Java-2018-19
In 2018/19 I attended course called "Introduction to Java" at University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.
There are only 8 homeworks because, unfortunately, I voluntarily quit after first half of the course.
This course was my first time programming in Java, so you can see how I have progressed over time.
